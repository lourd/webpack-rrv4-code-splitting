# What is this ðŸ¤”
A super simple web app demonstrating how to use the [React Router v4](https://react-router.now.sh/) and Webpack v2 APIs together to make a dynamically growing React app. It shows 5 whole words; it's the most amazing thing you've ever seen! ðŸ™„

The meat of it is in `App.js` and `asyncComponent.js`; there's some comments in the code explaining what's happening. See it in action at [lourd.github.io/webpack-rrv4-code-splitting](https://lourd.github.io/webpack-rrv4-code-splitting). Open the Network section of your dev tools to get a better sense of what's happening.
